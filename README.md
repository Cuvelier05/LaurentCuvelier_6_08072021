DESCRIPTION
This folder contains the front end files of project number 6 of the Openclassrooms web developer training course.

TO RUN THIS PROJECT
. Open a new terminal 
. Go to backend folders 
. You must install:
  - [NodeJS] (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) in version 12.14 or 14.0
  - [Angular CLI] (https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) in version 7.0.2.
  - [node-sass] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass): be careful to take the version corresponding to NodeJS. For Node 14.0 for example, install node-sass in version 4.14+.
(cd ./frontend -> npm install -g npm@latest -> npm install -g @angular/cli@7.0.2
npm install  -> npm install node-sass@4.14.1
ng serve)
(cd ./backend -> nodemon server)

GOAL
This is my first backend project.
